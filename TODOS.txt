Base functionality:
* Displays desired:
  - Display schedule for today/weekly
  - Display TODOS for today/weekly in some priority order
  - Display TODOS and schedule for today combined
* Tests
* Extend date parser to accept
  - "next friday" "this friday"
  - "two fridays from now"
* Lots of comments before I forget everything
* Enforce correct constrains on which flags have to be there with which other flags
* Better arguments in general
* README with examples
* License
* Verication message after adding events/tasks
* Handle time-on-date correctly when it comes to events spanning multiple days
  - This is probably done now but hasn't been tested

Other:
* GUI display (no input) a la Google Calendar - HTML templatey thing?
* Automatic ICS migration
* Ability to import calendar from existing .json or ICS
* Better task sorting
* Peter wants to be able to track the time completed
