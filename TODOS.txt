Right now, in order:
* All tasks display
* Task completion
* Stuff deletion
* Stuff editing which is secretly just stuff recreation
* Verification messages
* Extend parser
  - "Friday" should mean the following friday, not the current one
* Better arguments
  - Optional end-time or duration
* README with examples

Base functionality:
* Actual Python tests
* Extend date parser to accept
  - "next friday" "this friday"
  - "two fridays from now"
* Lots of comments before I forget everything
* Enforce correct constrains on which flags have to be there with which other flags
* Better arguments in general
* README with examples
* License
* Verication message after adding events/tasks
* Command for "completing" tasks
* Optionally specify either duration or end time
* Do something about the fact that importing dateparser is horrifically slow

Other:
* GUI display (no input) a la Google Calendar - HTML templatey thing?
* Automatic ICS migration
* Ability to import calendar from existing .json or ICS
* Better task sorting
* Peter wants to be able to track the time completed
