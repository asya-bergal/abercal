Right now, in order:
* Stuff editing which is secretly just stuff recreation
* README with examples

Base functionality:
* Actual Python tests
* Lots of comments before I forget everything
* Enforce correct constrains on which flags have to be there with which other flags
* README with examples
* License
* Optionally specify either duration or end time

Other:
* Better editing:
  e.g., add exception rather than restate exception list
* GUI display (no input) a la Google Calendar - HTML templatey thing?
* Automatic ICS migration
* Ability to import calendar from existing .json or ICS
* Better task sorting
* Peter wants to be able to track the time completed
