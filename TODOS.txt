Base functionality:
* Display of any kind
  - This is complicated because displays are what should
    calculate local time stuff and deal with repeated events
* Tests
* Lots of comments before I forget everything
* Task "completion"
* Enforce correct constrains on which flags have to be there with which other flags
* Add optional end date for repeating events
  - Probably I should add a new "Repeater" class
* Have event exceptions work correctly. Current failure mode:
  - Add datetimes and repeat_days
  - Add exception as string, but "tomorrow" is a precise date time which doesn't actually map
    to one of the existing datetimes + some multiple of repeat_days
  Basically henever you do stuff with it you should only count the day part of exceptions,
  the exact datetime doesn't matter.

Other:
* Add type annotations? because jesus christ python
* Automatic ICS migration
* Ability to import calendar from existing .json or ICS
* Better task sorting
* Better file separation
